# c.3n_plus_1

Display the 3n+1 conjecture series known as the Collatz conjecture.

The rule to follow is simple.

1.  Take any positive number as the starting point.
2.  If the number n is odd, the next number is 3n+1 otherwise it is n/2.
3.  The series should end with 1.

When you reach 1, the series will cycle indefinetly.

The code is written in C.
